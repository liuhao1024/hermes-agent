"""Tests for `hermes memory status` CLI command.

Covers:
- Status output clarity when no provider is configured (built-in only)
- Status output clarity when an external provider is configured
- The status message should NOT confuse "built-in memory subsystem"
  with the "built-in storage backend" (issue #18404)
